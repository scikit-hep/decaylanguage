<!-- break -->

A language to describe particle decays, and tools to work with them.

# Installation

Just run the following:

```bash
pip install decaylanguage
```

You can use a virtual environment through pipenv or with `--user` if you know
what those are. [Python 2.7 and 3.4+](http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/starting/installation) are supported.

# Usage

This is a quick user guide; for full API docs, go [here](https://decaylanguage.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

DecayLanguage is a set of tools for building and transforming particle
decays. The parts are:

## Particles

You can use a variety of methods to get particles; if you know the PDG
number you can get a particle directly, or you can use a search:

```python
Particle.from_pdgid(211)
Particle.from_search_list(name='pi')[0]
```

You can search for the properties, which are `name`, `mass`, `width`,
`charge`, `A`, `rank`, `I`, `J`, `G`, `P`, `quarks`, `status`, `latex`,
`mass_upper`, `mass_lower`, `width_upper`, and `width_lower` (some of
those don\'t make sense). You can also use `from_search` to require only
one match.

Once you have a particle, any of the properties can be accessed, along
with several methods. Though they are not real properties, you can
access `bar`, `radius`, and `spin_type`. You can also `invert()` a
particle. There are lots of printing choices, `describe()`,
`programmatic_name()`, `html_name()`, html printing outs in notebooks,
and of course `repr` and `str` support.

You can quickly search for particles from the command line with:

```
python -m decaylanguage.particle 311
```

You can put one or more PDG ID numbers here, or string names.

## Decays

The most common way to create a decay chain is to read in an [AmpGen]
style syntax from a file or a string. You can use:

```python
from decaylanguage.decay import AmplitudeChain
lines, parameters, constants, states = AmplitudeChain.read_ampgen(text='''
EventType D0 K- pi+ pi+ pi-

D0[D]{K*(892)bar0{K-,pi+},rho(770)0{pi+,pi-}}                            0 1 0.1 0 1 0.1

K(1460)bar-_mass  0 1460 1
K(1460)bar-_width 0  250 1

a(1)(1260)+::Spline::Min 0.18412
a(1)(1260)+::Spline::Max 1.86869
a(1)(1260)+::Spline::N 34
''')
```

Here, `lines` will be a list of AmplitudeChain lines (pretty print supported in Jupyter notebooks), 
`parameters` will be a table of parameters (ranged parameters not yet supported),
`constants` will be a table of constants,
and `states` will be the list of known states (EventType).

## Converters

You can output to a format (currently only [GooFit] supported, feel free
to make a PR to add more). Use a subclass of DecayChain, in this case,
GooFitChain. To use the [GooFit] output, type from the shell:

```bash
python -m decaylanguage.decay -G goofit myinput.opts
```
