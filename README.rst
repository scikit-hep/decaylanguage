A language to describe particle decays, and tools to work with them.


Installation
============

Just run the following:

::

    pip install decaylanguage


You can use a virtual environment through `pipenv` or `--user` if you know what those are.

Usage
=====

This is a quick user guide; for full API docs, see https://decaylanguage.readthedocs.io/en/latest/

DecayLanguage is a set of tools for building and transforming particle decays. The parts are:

Particles
---------

You can use a variety of methods to get particles; if you know the PDG number you can get a particle directly, or you can use a search::

    Particle.from_pdg(211)
    Particle.from_search_list(name='pi')[0]

You can search for the properties, which are ``name``, ``mass``, ``width``, ``charge``, ``A``, ``rank``, ``I``, ``J``, ``G``, ``P``, ``quarks``, ``status``, ``latex``, ``mass_upper``, ``mass_lower``, ``width_upper``, and ``width_lower`` (some of those don't make sense). You can also use ``from_search`` to require only one match.

Once you have a particle, any of the properties can be accessed, along with several methods. Though they are not real properties, you can access ``bar``, ``radius``, and ``spintype``. You can also ``invert()`` a particle. There are lots of printing choices, ``describe()``, ``programmatic_name()``, ``html_name()``, html printing outs in notebooks, and of course ``repr``
and ``str`` support.

Decays
------

The most common way to create a decay chain is to read in an AmpGen style syntax from a file or a string.

Converters
----------

You can output to a format (currently only GooFit supported, feel free to make a PR to add more). Use a subclass of `DecayChain`, in this case, `GooFitChain`.
